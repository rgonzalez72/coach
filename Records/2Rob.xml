<session>I felt like running today, so went for an easy run, and then did the physical work out afterwards. I only did the physical work out once, but did all the routines, and it felt like a good work out

Again, I did the easy run, trying to control my breath - which is dependant on slowing down a bit, and trying to concentrate more on better breathing as well as form

I arranged to meet Paul Hammond today at Eastleigh parkrun, to practise some more with his camera, so I decided to incorporate my run to and from Eastleigh parkrun. I took about 940 ish pictures in total, and a lot more than last time were in focus, so that's good for taking the pictures for the LRR 10K!

I had a lot of side on shots and it's interesting to see the running form of everyone, taking into account of what's you've said about extending the hips...

It was just over 5 miles there, then I took pictures for about 40 minutes at parkrun, then I ran back (so I had a 40 minute rest! - But I was standing around all the time)

<session>
his is the first day of my run 1 mile every day before breakfast month! So when I do my run training - typically after work in the evenings, then I'll also have done a 1 mile easy run in the morning too. For the 1 mile easy run in the morning, I'm just running based on feeling, so that my breathing is easy and trying to make sure that running form is as good as I can make it. For the last 30 seconds of the run, I do strides x2, which is one stride being about a 5 second acceleration to max speed, then a 5 second slow down, a 5 second jog, then repeat.

Morning easy run :
Distance 1.22 miles
Total time 10mins 31seconds
Average min/mile 8:36

Mile 1 8:36
Mile 2 8:23

Enthusiasm 6 (due to being a bit tired)
Energy before 6
Energy after 7 (was fully awake after the run)

Evening run, on the same day
Even though the training was Physical preparation, circuit x3, I felt like a run before the physical training, so I went for another easy run, just basing pace on my breathing being controlled :

Distance 4:85
Total time 40mins 58seconds
Average min/mile 8:27

Mile 1 8:12
Mile 2 8:49
Mile 3 8:32
Mile 4 8:17
Mile 5 8:16

Enthusiasm 7.5
Energy before 7
Energy after 7

After I did the physical preparation circuit X1, plus 1 extra set of squats. I was knackered after this, so decided I was in need of a rest.
