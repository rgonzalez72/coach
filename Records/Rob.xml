<session>Completed, plus did another 2 miles at "medium" pace, afterwich, was starting to feel it, so decided
to stop. Was hoping to do a 10 mile run, but body wasn't up to it.
I think there's some thing wrong with my running phone app, as although it recorded the speed of each training
interval, when I looked at it today, there's only the time per mile available. Sorry about that.

<session>Woke up early and decided to do a longer run before parkrun. Left about 8am, and ran around the
common for about 6.5 miles, then had about a 5 minute rest, before doing parkrun, and then ran home at slow
recovery pace. As I was concentrating more on pace, and not on time, Parkrun seemed to go by really quickly
and I was at the end in no time. This was probably because of running for about 40 minutes before, compared to
running just under 22 minutes for parkrun (finished in 75th position - registered as "unknown", as I didn't
        scan my presonnal barcode)

<session>2x4x80m hills [2']+ 4x120m acceleration. I did this as part of Lordshill RR Monday night training. The training plan was in my phone running app, although this didn't match the distance which the hill training we did at Southampton Sports centre - running up the hill to the 7th (I think it was) lampost, so I turned off the phone, and didn't record any times, as the voice instructions on my running app were distracting. After training legs felt quite stiff. </session>

<session>Met up with Mike M (another LRR runner), and Alan G (friend from parkrun) 8:30am to go for a longer run. Went from the common to Southampton football club, following roughly the route in reverse of the Southampton half marathon. At the beginning I had to ask the other's to slow down, as the pace was too fast for me, although after about the 4th mile I started to feel good, and at mile 6 I had to slow down for the others. The last mile or so, I took slow, running back from Southampton football club, to where I live in St. Denys, then the others went back to the common.

<session>ut instead did fartleg in the Common with Lordshill monday training Group F.
Felt pretty tired before setting off, and really wanted to do a recovery run, but the training was ok - it wasn't my fastest, due to being a bit knackered, but still was good.

As per usual, the times recorded are only a rough indication of speed, as waiting around as well as running was recorded, but at least the distance is accurate :

Mile 1 - 9:26 (run / jog to traning)
Mile 2 - 20:17 (includes waiting around at start)
Mile 3 - 8:01 (warmup)
Mile 4 - 17:40 (includes excersices in the common)
Mile 5 - 7:26 (fartleg begins)
Mile 6 - 7:24
Mile 7 - 8:47
Mile 8 - 16:02 (includes warm down excersices)
Mile 9 - 7:51 (run / jog home)

<session>Felt fairly good before running. Did the first interfval too fast, whilst the last couple we're hard. As mentioned afterwards, the GPS on my phone indicated that I had finished 800m earlier than expected - roughly 50m before going round the track twice, This meant that the 2 min slow run intervals were shorter - which is probably good practise!

800m 5.36

Then after about 20 minutes, I did Hills 2x5x80m. [2'], on the Eastleigh parkrun course - going up the main hill (which in parkrun, you normally run down)
(didn't do the Acceleration 5x120m was was quite knackered afterwards!)

Felt quite slow doing this, although the hill was quite muddy and I was trying out my new trail shoes for the first time - which definately helped!

Also, the running app wasn't accurate for each repetition, as it told me to stop at different distances, so I think the times are just for an indication really.

1st Set x5 :
Distance = 1.04 miles
Duration = 10:25 minutes
Averge min/nile = 10.09
 
Mile 1 - 9:32
Mile 2 - 19:26 (I think I must have forgotten to stop the running app after I finished for this time!)

2nd Set x5 :
Distance = 0.96 miles
Duration = 9:12 minutes
Averge min/nile = 9.37
 
Mile 1 - 9:21

Had a few minute break, and then repeated all the excersices

Press up on the second repetition was amongst the hardest - got up to 14, then had a rest, then up to 18, had to stop and rest again, and then the last two were just as hard!
The last part of each excersice (reps or holding the posture) on the second time around were quite hard, although after about 20 minutes felt ok again

Intervals 6x800m Rest 2 mins slow run

I did this with Tim and Alex at the track. This time I didn't set off so fast, which was better for my endurance for later in the training session. Before the session, felt tired mainly due to work, so wasn't expecting too much. Unfortunately the intervals didn't record on my running app, but I think, if I remember the 800m's were around 6:30 minutes / mile , and the 2 minutes slow were about 7:30 min / mile.

<session>outhampton half marathon. Eat a very small portion of porridge 2 hours before and then a banana 1 hour before the race. Felt good for the first 4 or 5 miles, and then legs felt quite heavy! When I couldn't keep up with the 1 hour 30 minute pacers on the Itchen bridge, I knew I'd be lucky to finish under 1 hour 30! Dug in and felt ok till Burgess road, then was pretty tired going up there till the common, then managed to pick up the pace a little till the end - where at the finish line, a first aider took me aside and I spent 20 minutes in the first aid tent, as I looked pale and was a bit wobbly!

Decided to get up early to do 9 or 10 miles, and then finish off doing Eastleigh parkrun (as you know Southampton PR was cancelled), but I didn't get up early enough and only did 7.5 miles before having to drive to Eastleigh in time for the Parkrun start!
